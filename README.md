# Test for image sharp

The aim of this is just to debug issues that I am having with gatsby's excellent [plugin-image-sharp](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp), which is not writing images to the filesystem and not erroring.

## Get it working

To run the script:

```bash
# install
npm i

# and run...
node ./src/index.js
# or
npm start
```
